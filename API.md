### IMPORTANT NOTE

For the security of your application, you should send the IP address of the end user in all requests. To do this, you need to add X-Vfk-Forwarded-For header parameter in all requests.

### Get a list of validation methods.

There are verification methods and language variables that you can use while preparing your verification screens. Response also includes specific warning messages in cases of errors for developers to act upon.


##### Example curl request

```bash
curl --request GET 'https://web-rest.verifykit.com/v1.0/init' \
--header 'X-Vfk-Server-Key: YOUR-SERVER-KEY' \
--header 'X-Vfk-Forwarded-For: END-USER-IP-ADDRESS' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

##### Example response body

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "requestId": "REQUEST-ID",
        "httpStatusCode": 200
    },
    "result": {
        "list": [
            {
                "appPackage": "whatsapp",
                "name": "WhatsApp",
                "app": "whatsapp",
                "text": "Verify via WhatsApp",
                "textColour": "ffffff",
                "bgColour": "1bd741",
                "icon": "https://web-rest.verifykit.com/img/web/whatsapp@3x.png"
            },
            {
                "appPackage": "telegram",
                "name": "Telegram",
                "app": "telegram",
                "text": "Verify via Telegram",
                "textColour": "ffffff",
                "bgColour": "61a8de",
                "icon": "https://web-rest.verifykit.com/img/web/telegram@3x.png"
            },
            {
                "appPackage": "otp",
                "name": "Sms",
                "app": "otp",
                "text": "Click to verify via SMS",
                "textColour": "ffffff",
                "bgColour": "cbcbd0",
                "icon": "https://web-rest.verifykit.com/img/web/otp@3x.png"
            }
        ],
        "description": "Please tap on your preferred messaging app and send us the code appearing on the screen.",
        "localizationList": [
            {
                "key": "validation.description",
                "value": "Please tap on your preferred messaging app and send us the code appearing on the screen."
            },
            {
                "key": "validation.chooseAppText",
                "value": "Select a messaging app to verify your phone number."
            },
            .
            .
            .
        ],
        "messages": []
    }
}

```

If your view selection in your application settings is to show the SMS option with other validation methods, the method of validation by SMS comes in the list parameter as in the code snippet above. However, if you want to show your users this option as an alternative, the parameters of the SMS validation method options will be as follows.

```json
{
    "alternativeValidation": "otp",
    "alternativeValidationDescription": "Don't use any of these apps?"
}
```



### Start a validation.

When your users choose a validation method from the screen you prepare, you can start the validation process by sending the "app" parameter of selected validation method to this endpoint.
â€‹
Three parameters are returned in the response. The first one is the "reference" code given to you in order to track the verification process on our end. The other two are the parameters you will use to verify your users. One of them is the qr code parameter which you can use if your users access your app through a browser. The other one is the deeplink to open the application in which your users will verify on their mobile devices.

##### Example curl request

```bash
curl  --request POST 'https://web-rest.verifykit.com/v1.0/start' \
--header 'X-Vfk-Server-Key: YOUR-SERVER-KEY' \
--header 'X-Vfk-Forwarded-For: END-USER-IP-ADDRESS' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"app":"whatsapp"}'
```

##### Example response body

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "requestId": "REQUEST-ID",
        "httpStatusCode": 200
    },
    "result": {
        "deeplink": "https://wa.me/905395744034?text=.....",
        "qrCode": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAA......",
        "reference": "111111"
    }
}
```

#### If the validation method is WhatsApp or Telegram

### Check that validation is complete.

With the "reference" code you received in the previous response, you can check whether the validation has been completed by the user or not.

If your user has completed the validation, you will receive a "session id" of this validation in the response.

##### Example curl request

```bash
curl  --request POST 'https://web-rest.verifykit.com/v1.0/check' \
--header 'X-Vfk-Server-Key: YOUR-SERVER-KEY' \
--header 'X-Vfk-Forwarded-For: END-USER-IP-ADDRESS' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"reference":"REFERENCE-OF-VALIDATION"}'
```

##### Example response body

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "requestId": "REQUEST-ID",
        "httpStatusCode": 200
    },
    "result": {
        "validationStatus": true,
        "sessionId": "QWERTY123456"
    }
}
```

#### If the validation method is SMS

Firstly, prepare a screen where your user will enter their phone number and country code. While preparing this screen, you can get the list of country information such as country code and phone code by sending a request to the "/country" endpoint like the example below.

##### Example curl request
```bash
curl  --request POST 'https://web-rest.verifykit.com/v1.0/country' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-Vfk-Forwarded-For: END-USER-IP-ADDRESS' \
--header 'X-Vfk-Server-Key: YOUR-SERVER-KEY' 
```

##### Example response body

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "requestId": "REQUEST-ID",
        "httpStatusCode": 200
    },
    "result": {
        "list": [
            {
                "phoneCode": "string",
                "countryCode": "string",
                "title": "string"
            },
            .
            .
            .
         ]
    }
}
```


### Send Otp Request

Then, you must post the country code  and the phone number that your user entered. The response you receive includes the "reference" you will use for checking status and the validity period of this verification. During this period, a validation code will be sent to the phone number that was entered by your user. Proceed to the next step to continue verification with the user-entered code.


##### Example curl request
```bash
curl  --request POST 'https://web-rest.verifykit.com/v1.0/send-otp' \
--header 'X-Vfk-Server-Key: YOUR-SERVER-KEY' \
--header 'X-Vfk-Forwarded-For: END-USER-IP-ADDRESS' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"phoneNumber":"PHONE_NUMBER","countryCode":"COUNTRY_CODE"}'
```

##### Example response body
````json
{
    "meta": {
        "requestId": "REQUEST-ID",
        "httpStatusCode": 201
    },
    "result": {
        "reference": "123456",
        "timeout": 300
    }
}
````

### Check Otp Result


With the "reference" code you received in the previous response, you can check whether the validation has been completed by the user or not.

If your user has completed the validation, you will receive a "session id" of this validation in the response which means the verification process sucessfully finished.



##### Example curl request
```bash
curl  --request POST 'https://web-rest.verifykit.com/v1.0/check-otp' \
--header 'X-Vfk-Server-Key: YOUR-SERVER-KEY' \
--header 'X-Vfk-Forwarded-For: END-USER-IP-ADDRESS' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"phoneNumber":"PHONE_NUMBER","countryCode":"COUNTRY_CODE","reference":"REFERENCE-OF-VALIDATION","code":"USER-ENTERED-CODE"}'
```

##### Example response body
```json
{
    "meta": {
        "requestId": "REQUEST-ID",
        "httpStatusCode": 200
    },
    "result": {
        "validationStatus": true,
        "sessionId": "QWERTY123456"
    }
}
```



### Last Step : Get result by session id.

This is where you will get your user's credentials such as phone number et cetera. You can complete the validation by sending the "session id" parameter of the validation here.

##### Example curl request

```bash
curl  --request POST 'https://api.verifykit.com/v1.0/result' \
--header 'X-Vfk-Server-Key: YOUR-SERVER-KEY' \
--header 'X-Vfk-Forwarded-For: END-USER-IP-ADDRESS' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"sessionId":"SESSION-ID-OF-VALIDATION"}'
```


##### Example response body

````json
{
    "meta": {
        "requestId": "REQUEST-ID",
        "httpStatusCode": 200
    },
    "result": {
        "validationType": "whatsapp",
        "validationDate": "Y-m-d H:i:s",
        "phoneNumber": "+9......",
        "countryCode": "TR"
    }
}
````

## Error Codes

If there are any errors, the response scheme you get will be as follows.

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "requestId": "REQUEST-ID",
        "httpStatusCode": "HTTP_STATUS_CODE",
        "errorMessage": "ERROR_MESSAGE",
        "errorCode": "ERROR_CODE"
    }
}
```
